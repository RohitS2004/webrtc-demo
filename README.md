# WebRTC Demo 
- This project is used to demonstrate how to establish a peer to peer connection in the most simplest way. There is no any backend server involved in this project and no any STUN server is invloved.

# Why this project?
- As someone who has just strated with WebRTC protocol and is struggling to get his head around all sort of different APIs that you WebRTC provides, this is a good project demostrating all the basic stuff that goes into establishing a successful connection.
